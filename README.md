## EEG Analysis for Neuropathic Pain Subjects

This repository contains MATLAB scripts designed for the analysis of EEG data from subjects with neuropathic pain. While the current implementation focuses primarily on eyes-closed EEG data, the code can be adapted or optimized for both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions, depending on your application.

### Requirements

**MATLAB R2019b**
**EEGLAB Toolbox** ([https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/))
* **Graph Theory Toolbox** by Sergii Iglin ([https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/5355-graph-theory-toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/5355-graph-theory-toolbox))

### Notes

**Data Preprocessing**: Proper preprocessing is essential for achieving reliable and reproducible results in EEG-based research. In particular, careful identification and rejection of artifactual independent components (ICs) is strongly recommended.
**Code Structure**: Most scripts include comments that explain their specific functions and workflows.

Please ensure all toolboxes are installed and paths correctly set before running the scripts.
